What happens if you drag and drop onto two overlapping gameobjects?

In Unity UI Toolkit, only the topmost element in the visual stacking order receives pointer and drag-and-drop events.
The system uses the picking order (based on visual stacking) to determine which element is under the pointer.
The topmost VisualElement handles the events, while elements underneath are ignored.

For Scene GameObjects, Unity performs an internal raycast and selects the first object hit as the target.
Objects behind the topmost one do not receive any drag-and-drop events.
