## Introduction

In this workshop, you will design and build (editor) UI in Unity using UI toolkit. You wil be making:
- A "Weapon Selector", editor UI that allows you to change NPC stats and weapons.
- A floating healthbar and name above NPCs, this is in-game UI. 

Each step has its own branch, which contain the answer to that step. These branches should be used if you are stuck on a certain step.

### Learning Goals
- Getting a general understanding of UXML, USS and C# within UI Toolkit
    - How C# can be used to dynamically create UI elements
    - How the interaction between UI and the Scene can be made
- Understanding how editor UI can be useful for level designers

### The end result
If you followed along with the steps, you should have:
- Your own custom "Weapon Selector" with the ability to:
    - Select NPCs
    - Select and equip weapons
    - Change the health and name of the selected NPC
